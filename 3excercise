#Finger exercise: Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and
#prints two integers, root and pwr, such that 0 < pwr < 6 and root**pwr is equal
#to the integer entered by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should
#print a message to that effect.

number = int(input('Please enter an integer: ')) #asks for the input

root = 0 #variable which checks whether the number is in the range <0,number>
power = 0 #powering number


while(root <= number and (root-1)**power != number): #root has to be smaller & result can't be determined yet.
    power = 0 #this always has to go (1,6) for every number POSSIBLY to be root.
    while(power < 6 and root**power != number):        
        power = power + 1
    root = root + 1

if((root-1)**power==number): #if we have found a good result, then prints it.
    print(root-1, 'pwd by', power, 'equals to', number)
else: #if we have not found a good result then prints unsucessful text.
    print('Number has no root powered by number in range(0,6)')
