Finger exercise: 
Write a program that examines three variablesâ€”x, y, and zâ€” and prints the largest odd number among them.
If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

x = int(input("Enter first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter second number: "))
z = int(input("Enter third number: "))


numbers_odd = [] #we will add later all even numbers entered by user.
numbers = [] #numbers is a list and we append x,y,z to it.
numbers.append(x)
numbers.append(y)
numbers.append(z)

for item in numbers:     #We add all even numbers to a new list
    if item % 2 != 0:
        pass #nothing happens if number is even.
    else:
        numbers_odd.append(item) #we append odd numbers to number_odd list.

if(numbers_odd == []): #if the list is empty, no odd numbers were entered.
    print('no odd numbers') 
else:
    print(max(numbers_odd)) #function max returns the maximal value of list.
